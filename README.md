# IMAGE READER

Implementation of a sequential and a parallel program for image reading.

The program reads 200.000 images from the directory, keeps the uncompressed bitmaps in an appropriate data structure, that manages access to the images.

We compute the execution time of the sequential and the parallel programs to calculate the speedup.
